|---|---|---|
| POS → ERP (sales) | 30 seconds | Inventory inaccuracy, stockouts, overselling on other channels |
| ERP → POS (prices) | 60 seconds | Wrong pricing at checkout, DTI price freeze non-compliance |
| ERP → ECOM (inventory) | 5 minutes | Overselling online |
| ECOM → ERP (orders) | 1 minute | Delayed order processing |
| WMS ↔ ERP (inventory) | 1 minute | DC inventory inaccuracy |
| Payment confirmation | 30 seconds | Failed order completion |

| Period | Activity | Additional Load |
|---|---|---|
| Month-end (last 3 days) | Close, accruals, reconciliation | +30% AP/AR processing, heavy reporting |
| Bi-monthly sale events | Promotional pricing, traffic surge | +100% POS volume, +200% ecommerce |
| Payroll dates (14th & 28th) | Payroll runs, bank file generation | Heavy HR/payroll module usage |
