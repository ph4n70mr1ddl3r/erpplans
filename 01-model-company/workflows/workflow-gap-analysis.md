# Workflow Gap Analysis — BuildRight Depot Corp.

> Methodology and results of the 2026-06-14 operational workflow gap analysis.
> Companion document to [value-stream-index.md](value-stream-index.md) and
> [workflow-criticality-classification.md](workflow-criticality-classification.md).

---

## 1. Purpose

Validate that the operational workflow inventory **comprehensively covers the operations of the
model company** (BuildRight Depot Corp. — a Philippine hardware/DIY/home-improvement big-box
retailer: 200 stores, 4 DCs, 35,000 active SKUs, ~800–1,000 vendors, ~PHP 62.3B annual revenue,
5 legal entities) as described in [model-company-profile.md](../model-company-profile.md), and
identify capability gaps not addressed by any existing value stream.

---

## 2. Method

1. **Inventory** the existing 84 value streams (256 process areas, 2,844 workflows) grouped by the
   8 operating families (Plan & Source, Make & Move, Sell & Serve, Finance, People, Asset &
   Infrastructure, Governance & Assurance, Technology & Data).
2. **Map** each major operational domain in the model company profile (merchandising, supply
   chain, store operations, POS/ecommerce, finance, HR, assets, governance/compliance, IT/data)
   to the value stream(s) that cover it.
3. **Flag gaps** where a domain had no dedicated value stream, only partial coverage, or was a
   known retired value stream (VS-49/50/51/52) not yet re-introduced.
4. **Validate** each candidate gap by keyword search across all PA files to confirm it is not
   already covered (avoiding redundant value streams) and to scope it so the new value stream is
   distinct from adjacent ones.
5. **Prioritize** gaps by operational criticality, regulatory exposure, and volume, and select the
   set to fill in this revision.

## 3. Gaps Identified

| # | Capability gap | Why it matters for BuildRight | Existing (partial) coverage | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Product Recall & Safety Corrective Action** | 35K SKUs incl. electrical, paint/chemical, power tools, appliances; Consumer Act (RA 7394) + DTI-BPS + FDA recall obligations; ~3–8 recalls/yr | Only the store-level *customer-notification execution* step exists (W776 in VS-09); no end-to-end recall program | **FILLED — VS-89** |
| 2 | **Damage, Claims & Freight Recovery** | ~72K inbound receipts/yr, ~5K store replenishment orders/month, ~42.9K ecommerce orders/month; vendor/carrier/customer damage and shortage across all legs; claim notice windows are short | Retired VS-50 (placeholder) was the home; typhoon damage handled in VS-69; no systematic damage/claims program | **FILLED — VS-90** |
| 3 | **Consumer Data Privacy & Data Protection** | ~600K loyalty members, ~5,200 B2B contacts, ~515K ecommerce orders/yr, CCTV across 200 stores; Data Privacy Act (RA 10173) + NPC, 72-hour breach notification | Employee data privacy only (W647 in VS-19); consumer program (consent, DSAR, PIA/DPIA, breach) absent | **FILLED — VS-91** |
| 4 | **Kitting, Bundling & Build-to-Order Assembly** | Kit/Bundle is an explicit item type (profile §6.4); bundle pricing (§9.3); contractor combo packs, seasonal kits | Retired VS-51 (placeholder); custom *fabrication* heavily covered (VS-09 PA-09.1); build-to-stock kit/bundle operations absent | **FILLED — VS-92** |
| 5 | Workforce Management & Labor Scheduling | 200 stores × 2–3 shifts × 29 staff; DOLE labor-code compliance | **Already covered** — PA-19.3 (Workforce Management, 10 workflows) in VS-19 | No action |
| 6 | Facilities, Equipment & Maintenance Management | 600 POS terminals, paint mixers, cutting equipment, forklifts, HVAC across 205 locations | **Substantially covered** — PA-20.3 (VS-20) + PA-07.2 (VS-07, incl. W47, W579, W1025, W1403) | No action |
| 7 | Dark Store & Micro-Fulfillment | Emerging micro-fulfillment for ecommerce | Retired VS-49 (placeholder); low near-term relevance for PH big-box provincial footprint | **Deferred** (future revision) |
| 8 | Cooperative & Community Enterprise Procurement | Community/cooperative buying programs | Retired VS-52 (placeholder); lower priority than items 1–4 | **Deferred** (future revision) |

### Candidate gaps considered but rejected (adequate coverage)

- **Strategic sourcing / RFP** — covered by VS-03 vendor management.
- **Loyalty / coalition partnerships** — covered by VS-13.
- **Tax compliance** — covered by VS-79 / VS-87.
- **Anti-counterfeit / product authentication** — covered by VS-71.
- **Trade credit / AR risk** — covered by VS-16 / VS-68.
- **Treasury / FX / intercompany** — covered by VS-18 / VS-72.

## 4. New Value Streams Added (2026-06-14)

Four value streams, 12 process areas, **96 workflows (W2993–W3088)**, distributed across two
families:

| VS | Value Stream | Family | Process Areas | Workflows | W-range |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [VS-89](VS-89-product-recall-safety-corrective-action/README.md) | Product Recall & Safety Corrective Action Management | Governance & Assurance | 3 | 24 | W2993–W3016 |
| [VS-90](VS-90-damage-claims-freight-recovery/README.md) | Damage, Claims & Freight Recovery Management | Make & Move | 3 | 24 | W3017–W3040 |
| [VS-91](VS-91-consumer-data-privacy-protection/README.md) | Consumer Data Privacy & Data Protection Program | Governance & Assurance | 3 | 24 | W3041–W3064 |
| [VS-92](VS-92-kitting-bundling-build-to-order-assembly/README.md) | Kitting, Bundling & Build-to-Order Assembly Operations | Make & Move | 3 | 24 | W3065–W3088 |

### Family subtotal impact

| Family | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Make & Move | 235 | **283** (+48) |
| Governance & Assurance | 480 | **528** (+48) |
| **Grand total** | **2,844** | **2,940** (+96) |
| Value streams | 84 | **88** (+4) |
| Process areas | 256 | **268** (+12) |

The 96 new workflows are currently **unclassified** (counted in the 1,773 unclassified total) and
will be tier-assigned in a follow-up criticality review. Several are anticipated Tier 1
(recall regulatory notification/stop-sale, DPA breach 72-hour NPC notification, freight/vendor
claim notice windows, DSAR statutory fulfillment).

---

## 5. Validation

`07-methodology/validate-repo.sh` passes with **0 errors** after the additions:

- Grand total (2,940) matches actual PA workflow header count (2,940). ✅
- All 1,167 classified workflow IDs resolve to a header. ✅
- No dangling workflow references in cross-reference docs. ✅
- No placeholder/skeleton workflow content. ✅
- All cross-document counts reconciled (README, executive-summary, value-stream-index,
  workflows/README, criticality classification, dependency map, touchpoint map,
  requirement-workflow-matrix). ✅

---

## 6. Remaining (deferred) gaps

- **VS-49-equivalent (Dark Store & Micro-Fulfillment)** and **VS-52-equivalent (Cooperative &
  Community Enterprise Procurement)** remain deferred. They have lower near-term operational
  priority for the current footprint and will be re-introduced with detailed workflows in a future
  revision if/when relevant.
